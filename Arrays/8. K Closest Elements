Given a sorted(non-decreasing) array A of N length, and two integers K, X. 
Write an efficient program to find K closest elements to X in A Note. 
If there is a tie between two elements in terms of closeness, choose the minimum one

Input
First line contains three space separated integers N, K, and X Second line contains N space separated integers of A.

Output
Print the K elements of A in sorted(non-decreasing) order based on the above context

Explanation
In Sample Input 1, we need to find the two closest elements. The first closest element is 7. 
For the second closest element, there is a tie between 6 and 10 as (10-8 is equal to 8-6). 
Here we choose 6, as it is mentioned in the question text to choose the minimum number in case of a tie. Therefore, the output is 67.

Constraints

1<= N <= 3*10^5

-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9

1 <= K <= N

-10^9 < X <= 10^9

Sample Input 1

5 2 8

1 3 6 7 10

Sample Output 1

6 7

Sample Input 2

5 3 6

1 3 5 7 10

Sample Output 2

3 5 7

Hint 1
Find the closest element to X and from there find the K closest elements.

Hint 2
The K closest elements always exist as a subarray of size K.

    low = 0
    high = a - b
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if c >= arr[mid+b]:
            low = mid + 1
        elif c <= arr[mid]:
            high = mid
        elif (arr[mid+b] + arr[mid]) / 2 < c:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    for i in range(low, low + b):
        print(arr[i], end = " ")
    return

        
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
arr = [int(val) for val in input().split()][:a]
k_closest_ele(a,b,c,arr)
