coin change(greedy) - Difficulty: Medium

Arjun is helping his grandmother count the money she has stored in her coin jar. The jar contains coins of the following denominations:
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500
One day, Arjun needs to take out a specific amount of money to pay for repairs. He wants to use as few coins as possible. Your task is to help Arjun determine how many coins of each denomination he should use to make the exact amount.

Input Format
A single integer N — the amount Arjun needs to form.

Constraints
1≤N≤10^6
Available denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500
Use minimum number of coins (greedy solution always works for these denominations)

Output Format
Print the number of coins used from highest to lowest denomination. For each denomination used, print:

Sample Input 0
1300
Sample Output 0
500-1
200-1
100-1

Python:
Approach 1:
def coin_change(n):
    change = [500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
    res = []
    i = 0
    for c in change:
        if n == 0:
            break
        
        count = n // c
        if count > 0:
            res.append((c, count))
            n = n % c
    return res
n = int(input())
for coin, count in coin_change(n):
    print(f"{coin}-{count}")

Approach 2:
def coin_change(n):
    change = [500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
    res = []
    i = 0 
    while len(change) > i:
        if n == 0:
            break
        coin = change[i]
        count = n // coin
        if count > 0:
            res.append((coin, count))
            n = n % coin
        i += 1
    return res
n = int(input())
for coin, count in coin_change(n):
    print(f"{coin}-{count}")

            }
            i++;

        Scanner ip = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = ip.nextInt();
        List<int[]> res = coin_change(n);
        for(int[] pair: res){
            System.out.println(pair[0] + "-" + pair[1]);
        }
    }
