Level: Easy

Given an array A of N lerigth containing Os and 1s, and an integer K representing the number of flips allowed. 
You can flip Os into 1s at most K times. Write an efficient program to find the longest continuous series of is while performing at most K flips

Input
First line contains two space separated integers N and K Second line contains N space separated integers of A

Output
Print the start index and the end index of the longest continuous series based on the above context. 
If there are multiple solutions, print the one with minimum start index.

Explanation
in Sample input 1 we are allowed to make only 1 flip. if we flip the O present at the 3rd index, we get the maximum number of continuous ones. So the output is 14.

Constraints
1 <= N, K <= 3 * 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 1

Sample Input 1
9 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

Sample Output 1
1 4

Sample Input 2
10 2
1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1

Sample Output 2
0 5

Hint:
Use a sliding window.

Python 3.10:

    maxLen = -100000000000
    left = right = start_idx = 0
    
    while right < a:
        while right < a and (arr[right] == 1 or b > 0):
            if arr[right] == 0:
                b -= 1
            right += 1
        length = right - left
        if length > maxLen:
            maxLen = length
            start_idx = left
        while left < a and arr[left] == 1:
            left += 1
        left += 1
        b += 1
    print(start_idx, start_idx+maxLen-1)

a, b= map(int, input().split())
arr = [int(val) for val in input().split()][:a]
maxi_continuous(a, b, arr)
