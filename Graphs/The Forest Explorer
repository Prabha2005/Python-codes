A young forest explorer, Aarav, is tracking the locations of rare trees in a forest. Each tree has a unique height. As he moves deeper into the forest, he plants trees at different spots and keeps track of them in a special system.

He wants to organize these trees so that searching for a particular height is easier. Therefore, he builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) where:

Every tree's height is unique.

The left branch contains trees shorter than the current tree.

The right branch contains trees taller than the current tree.

Now, Aarav is curious about what trees are at a particular depth in the forest. You are tasked to help him find and print all trees at level K from the root. Note: - Level 0 is the root. - The tree is built as a BST by inserting nodes one by one.

Input Format

The first line contains space-separated integers representing the heights of the trees (the BST nodes), in the order they are inserted.

The second line contains the integer K, representing the level whose nodes need to be printed.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5 Where N is the number of nodes in the BST.

0 <= K <= N-1

1 <= tree height <= 10^9

All tree heights are unique.

Output Format

Print all the tree heights at level K separated by spaces, from left to right.

If no nodes are present at that level, print an empty line.
