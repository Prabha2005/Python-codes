Identify correct operator

An expression E is passed as an input to the program. The expression will contain three numbers A, B and C, one equal symbol and one of the mathematical operators +-*/
But the given mathematical operator is incorrect and hence the expression is not valid. Hence the program must identify the correct operator and print that as the output.

Input Format:
First line will contain the expression E

Output Format:
First line will contain the correct mathematical operator

Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
5-4-20
Output:
Explanation:
Only 5 multiplied with 4 gives 20. Hence - must be replaced with *.

Example 2:
Input:
999+9=111
Output: /
Explanation:
Only 999 divided by 9 gives 111. Hence + must be replaced with /.

Python:
s = input().strip()
for i in "+-*/":
   sep = s.replace(i, " ").replace("=", " ").split()
   if len(sep) == 3:
      a, b, c = map(int, sep)
      break
if a + b == c:
   print("+")
elif a - b == c:
   print("-")
elif a * b == c:
   print("*")
else:
   print("/")
