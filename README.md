# Python Coding Practice & DSA
A collection of Python programs solved during coding practice and technical interview preparation.

## Topics Covered
- Python Fundamentals
- Arrays and Lists
- String Manipulation
- Recursion
- Searching and Sorting
- Greedy Algorithms
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees (Traversals & Problems)
- Mathematical and Logical Problems
- Interview & Competitive Programming Challenges

## Problem Types
- Maximum subarray and budget problems
- Work allocation and scheduling
- Tree-based problems and traversals
- Linked list operations
- Logic and constraint-based problems
- Real-world interview-style challenges

## Structure
Each folder/file represents an independent problem solution with a clear problem statement and Python implementation.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone the repository
3. Run any file using: `python filename.py`

## Purpose
This repository reflects my continuous learning, logical thinking, and preparation for coding interviews and assessments.

## Learning Path
Problems are organized from basic Python logic to advanced data structure and interview-level challenges.
