The Binary Curse

In the ancient city of Bitland, every citizen carries a Binary Identity String—a string containing only 0s and 1s. The ugliness of a citizen is simply the decimal value of this binary string.

However, a strange curse has spread across the city: The higher a citizen’s ugliness, the more misfortune follows them.

You, as the Royal Bit-Mage, are given the identity string of one citizen. You are also granted a limited number of gold coins (CASH) to help them reduce their ugliness.

To purify their identity string, you may perform two types of magic operations:

Allowed Magic Operations

Swap Magic Swap any two characters in the string. Cost: A coins per swap.

Flip Magic Flip a bit (0 → 1 or 1 → 0). Cost: B coins per flip.

You may perform any number of operations as long as you have enough coins.

Your goal is to minimize the ugliness (decimal value of the resulting binary string). Return the minimized value modulo 10⁹ + 7.

Input Format

N – length of the string S – the binary identity string CASH – total coins available A – cost of swapping any two bits B – cost of flipping any one bit

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 1 ≤ len(S) ≤ 100000 1 ≤ CASH ≤ 100000 1 ≤ A ≤ 100000 1 ≤ B ≤ 100000

Output Format

The minimum ugliness achievable (modulo 10⁹ + 7).
