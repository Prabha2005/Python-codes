The Magical Number System

Long ago, in a futuristic IT academy, students learned ancient number systems used by early computers. One student, Arun, discovered a strange pattern:

When converting some decimal numbers into another base, the resulting number has all identical digits!

For example: 63 (base 10) → 333 (base 4) All digits are the same: 3, 3, 3

Arun is fascinated and wants to explore this magic further.

🧠 Your Task

Given a natural number M in decimal form, find the smallest possible base B such that when M is expressed in base B, ✔️ Its representation contains only one repeated digit (like 111, 22222, 555, etc.)

You must find and print this smallest base B.

Input Format

A single integer M A single integer B

Constraints

1≤M≤10^12 Base B must be: 𝐵>the repeated digit 𝐵≥2

Output Format

A single integer → the minimum base B such that the representation of M in base B has all identical digits.
