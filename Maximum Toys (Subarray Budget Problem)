📌 Problem: Maximum Toys (Subarray Budget Problem)
Problem Statement

You are given an array prices where each element represents the price of a toy. You are also given an integer money representing your total budget.

Your task is to find the maximum number of consecutive toys you can buy such that the total cost does not exceed the given budget.

Return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to money.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of toys.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the prices of the toys.

The third line contains an integer money, representing the budget.

Output Format

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive toys that can be bought within the given budget.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵

1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10⁵

1 ≤ money ≤ 10⁹

Example
Input
7
1 4 5 3 2 1 6
6

Output
3

Explanation

The subarray [3, 2, 1] has a total cost of 6, which is within the budget and has the maximum possible length.

def maximumToys(prices: List[int], money: int) -> int:

Approach

Use the Sliding Window technique.

Maintain a window with two pointers to track consecutive toys.

Expand the window by including the next toy.

Shrink the window when the total price exceeds the budget.

Track the maximum window size.
