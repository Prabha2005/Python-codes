📌 Problem: Stepping Numbers in a Range
Problem Statement

A number is called a Stepping Number if the absolute difference between every pair of adjacent digits is exactly 1.

Given two integers N and M, print all Stepping Numbers between N and M (inclusive) in increasing order.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N.

The second line contains an integer M.

Output Format

Print all Stepping Numbers between N and M separated by a space.

If no Stepping Numbers exist in the given range, print -1.

Constraints

0 ≤ N ≤ M ≤ 10⁹

Example 1

Input

0
21


Output

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 21

Example 2

Input

10
15


Output

10 12

Explanation

10 → |1 − 0| = 1

12 → |1 − 2| = 1

21 → |2 − 1| = 1

All satisfy the Stepping Number condition.

Function Signature (LeetCode Style)
def steppingNumbers(N: int, M: int) -> List[int]:

Expected Approach

Use BFS with Queue or DFS (recursion) to generate valid Stepping Numbers.

Start from digits 0 to 9 and build numbers by appending digits whose difference is 1.

Time Complexity

O(K), where K is the number of stepping numbers generated.

Space Complexity
