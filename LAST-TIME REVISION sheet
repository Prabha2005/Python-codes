# FINAL, LAST-TIME REVISION sheet for Sliding Window. #
Save this. Read it once before exams/interviews. That’s enough.

🧠 SLIDING WINDOW — FINAL REVISION (UNFORGETTABLE)
1️⃣ WHEN to use Sliding Window (NO THINKING)

Use it immediately if you see:
Subarray / Substring
Continuous elements
Max / Min / Longest / Smallest

👉 If all 3 appear → Sliding Window

2️⃣ ONE CORE IDEA (REMEMBER FOREVER)

Don’t recalculate. Reuse.

Window moves like this:

Add right

Remove left

3️⃣ TWO TYPES (ONLY THESE)
🔹 A) FIXED WINDOW

✔ Window size = k is given

Examples

Max sum of subarray of size k

Average of size k

Pattern

window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
answer = window_sum

for i in range(k, n):
    window_sum += arr[i]
    window_sum -= arr[i-k]
    answer = max(answer, window_sum)


🧠 Memory line:

Right enters, left exits

🔹 B) VARIABLE WINDOW

✔ Window size changes
✔ Condition-based

Examples

Longest subarray with sum ≤ K

Smallest subarray with sum ≥ K

4️⃣ GOLDEN TEMPLATE (MEMORIZE THIS)
left = 0
current = 0
answer = 0

for right in range(n):
    current += arr[right]      # expand

    while condition breaks:
        current -= arr[left]   # shrink
        left += 1

    answer = max(answer, right - left + 1)  # update


🧠 Chant this:

Expand → Check → Shrink → Update

5️⃣ MOST IMPORTANT LINE (DO NOT FORGET)

Update answer AFTER shrinking

That is where people fail.

right - left + 1

6️⃣ YOUR EXACT PROBLEM (FINAL FORM)
Longest Subarray with Sum ≤ K
left = 0
res = 0
max_len = 0

for right in range(n):
    res += arr[right]

    while res > k:
        res -= arr[left]
        left += 1

    max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

print(max_len)


✔ Works because all numbers are positive

7️⃣ 10-SECOND DECISION RULE (EXAMS)

Ask yourself:

Continuous?

Subarray?

Optimize something?

✔ YES → Sliding Window
❌ NO → Not Sliding Window

8️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

❌ Updating answer before shrinking
❌ Forgetting right - left + 1
❌ Using sliding window with negative numbers (unless special case)

9️⃣ ONE-LINE FINAL MEMORY LOCK 🔒

Sliding Window = Add right, remove left, update length
