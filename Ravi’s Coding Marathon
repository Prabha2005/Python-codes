Ravi is participating in a week-long coding marathon, where each day offers a different amount of energy reward based on performance.

Ravi wants to maximize his total energy over the entire marathon. But he must follow these rules:

⚡ Rules

If Ravi skips a day → he earns 0 energy and fully recovers.

If Ravi works on day i without working on the previous day, he earns full energy[i].

If Ravi works on day i after also working on day i−1 (two consecutive working days), fatigue kicks in, and he earns floor(energy[i] / 2).

Ravi may choose to work or skip on any day.

🎯 Goal

Find the maximum total energy Ravi can earn.

Input Format

First line: integer N → number of days Second line: N integers representing energy[i] of each day (If N = 0, the second line will be empty)

Constraints

0 ≤ N ≤ 100000 0 ≤ energy[i] ≤ 10⁹

Output Format

A single integer → maximum total achievable energy
