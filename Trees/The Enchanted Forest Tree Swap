The Enchanted Forest Tree Swap

Discussions
In an enchanted forest, trees are organized in a special way. Every tree has branches that lead to two directions — left and right. One day, a mysterious spell is cast over the forest, and the branches of every tree need to be swapped to face the opposite direction to balance the forest’s magic.

Your task is to help the forest guardians by converting the given tree structure into its mirror form, where for every tree, its left and right branches are swapped.

Input Format

The first line contains space-separated integers representing the node values of the tree in level-order.

Use -1 to indicate that a node does not have a left or right child.

Constraints

-10^9 <= node value <= 10^9

The tree may be incomplete.

Output Format

Print the level-order traversal of the tree after converting it into its mirror form. Use space separation.

Original tree: 1 / \ 2 3 / \ \ 4 5 6

After mirroring:
